        Hi __mentorname! <br><br>

        You will be mentoring on <b>__sessionslot</b> in the <b>__programname 
        mentor program</b> for the next 4 months. If you can extend your commitment from the
        four month minimum, it will greatly increase the potential impact on your mentee's life,
        as the main goal of the mentoring program is to provide the mentee with consistent support and 
        resources to become life-long learners. Your weekly meetings, no matter how insignificant
        they may seem, are key to this effort!<br><br>

        The Google Meets link you will use each week is here: __hangout<br>
        <b>You will need to be logged into your __vbbemail email account in order to join this video-call.</b>
        <br><br>
        
        When the time comes, click the link to begin the meeting, and give them about 5-10 minutes 
        to join. Make sure your computer has a built-in speaker and Microphone, or that you have 
        a headset plugged in. If they do not get  on the call within the first 10-15min, there may 
        be a power outage or poor connection so please don't give up on your mentee and keep trying
        each week. While you are waiting, feel free to check out some of the mentoring resources
        we have provided at https://portal.villagebookbuilders.org/ or do some of your own research!
        If you experience repeated technical difficulties, please email us at 
        mentor@villagebookbuilders.org for assistance or guidance. You can also contact the library 
        program director, __programdirector, at __pdemail. <b>As most programs are in third world 
        countries, we appreciate your patience.</b> <br> <br>

        As a last note, this session will be shifted with the US/Eastern timezone daylight savings schedule.
        If you live in a country that does not have daylight savings or follows a different schedule,
        you will need to plan accordingly. If you need to reschedule or have any other questions, 
        don't hesitate to reach out!<br><br>
        
        Looking forward to working with you!<br>
         - the VBB Mentoring Team
