        Hi __mentorname!
        <br>
        <br>
        Congratulations on becoming a Village Mentor! 
        You will be mentoring on <b>__sessionslot</b> 
        in the <b>__programname mentor program</b> 
        starting on <b>__start</b>. 
        The in-country program director at the school you will be mentoring for is __programdirector.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Google Meets link you will use each week is: __hangout<br>.
        You will need to be logged into your __vbbemail email account in order to join this video-call without issues.

        <b>Attendance Policy and Protocol</b>
        <br>
        We know things come up; however,
        <b>if you miss two consecutive sessions without notifying your program director in advance, we will remove you from your mentoring session.</b> 
        he reason for this is that some students walk hours to get to their session on time, 
        so you can imagine the disappointment when their mentor doesn’t show up. 
        Additionally, please make a special effort to be punctual!
        <br>
        <br>
        What to do if you cannot make it to a specific session:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Notify __programdirector at least 24 hours before your session via Facebook Workplace.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an activities/assignment plan for your student to do during the scheduled hour you aren't there for.
            </li>
            <li>
                Send the plan to __pdemail. 
                (please include your mentee's name in the subject line)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

                When you join, give your mentee about five minutes to join. 
                If they do not get on the call within that time, 
                contact your program director, __programdirector, via the Facebook Workplace Chat to let him know you are waiting.

            </li>
            <li>
                If you experience repeated technical difficulties or your assigned mentee has not been consistent,

        As a last note, this session has been booked in Universal Time and <b>WILL NOT be shifted</b> 
        with the daylight savings time shift in November or in March. 
        This means if you live in a country that follows some form of daylight savings, 
        you will need to plan accordingly. 
        (for example, make sure you can mentor an hour earlier during the fall/winter or an hour later during the spring/summer).
        <br>
        <br>
        Your mentor advisor will be reaching out to you with more information once you have been assigned a mentee. 
        As always, don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or run into any issues!
