        Hi __mentorname! <br><br>

        You will be mentoring on <b>__sessionslot</b> in the <b>__programname 
        mentor program</b> for the next 4 months, starting on <b>__start</b>. If you can extend your commitment from the
        four month minimum, it will greatly increase the potential impact on your mentee's life,
        as the main goal of the mentoring program is to provide the mentee with consistent support and 
        resources to become life-long learners. Your weekly meetings, no matter how insignificant
        they may seem, are key to this effort!<br><br>

        The Google Meets link you will use each week is here: __hangout<br>
        <b>You will need to be logged into your __vbbemail email account in order to join this video-call.</b>
        <br><br>
        
        When the time comes, click the link to begin the meeting, and give them about 5-10 minutes 
        to join. Make sure your computer has a built-in speaker and microphone, or that you have 
        a headset plugged in. If they do not get  on the call within the first 10-15 minutes, there may 
        be a power outage or poor connection, so please don't give up on your mentee and keep trying
        each week! While you are waiting, feel  free to check out some of the mentor training resources
        we have provided for you at https://portal.villagebookbuilders.org/ or do some of your own research!
        If you experience repeated technical difficulties, please email us at 
        mentor@villagebookbuilders.org for assistance or guidance. You can also contact the library 
        program director, __programdirector, at __pdemail. <b>As most programs are in third world 
        countries, we appreciate your patience.</b> <br> <br>

        As a last note, this session has been booked in Universal Time and <b>WILL NOT be shifted</b> with the
        daylight savings time shift in November or in March. This means if you live in a country that follows 
        some form of daylight savings, you will need to plan accordingly. (for example, make sure you can mentoring
        an hour earlier during the fall/winter and an hour later during the spring/summer).<br><br>
        
        If you need to reschedule or have any other questions, don't hesitate to reach out!<br>
