            Hi, __first_name, welcome to the VBB Mentoring Portal!
            <br>
            <br>
            We appreciate your willingness to be a mentor and change a life! 
            Now let's get you started!
            <br>
            <br>
            The next step is to sign up for a Mentor Orientation meeting.  
            This meeting will give you more details about the program and what to expect.  
            Click on this link to sign up for a meeting:
            <br>
            <br>
            <a href = "https://calendly.com/villagebookbuilders/mentor-orientation-and-scheduling ">
            https://calendly.com/villagebookbuilders/mentor-orientation-and-scheduling 
            </a>
            <br>
            <br>
            In the meantime, you can
            <a href = "https://accounts.google.com/AddSession">sign in to your new Google account by clicking here.</a>
            (if you don't sign in first, 
            the portal website will attempt to log you in with your current gmail account, and give you errors). 
            Your new account address is __new_email, and your temporary password is __password 
            <br>
            <br>
            Once you have configured your Gsuite account, return to the 
            <a href = "https://portal.villagebookbuilders.org/signin">Village Portal Signin page</a>, 
            where you will see a white button for signing in. 
            Click on that white button, then click on the __new_email option. 
            This should allow you to continue to the dashboard, 
            which will give you access to all kinds of mentoring resources!
