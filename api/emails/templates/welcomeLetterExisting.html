            Hi, __first_name, welcome to the VBB Mentoring Portal!<br><br>

            We appreciate your willingness to be a mentor and change a life! Now let's get you started!<br><br>
            
            First, make sure you are   
            <a href = "https://accounts.google.com/AddSession">signed in to your VBB GSuite account!</a>
            (if you don't sign in first, the website will attempt to log you in with your current GSuite 
            account, and give you errors). For reference, your villagementors email address (as was listed
            in your registration form) is __new_email.<br><br>

            Once you have configured your Gsuite account, return to the 
            <a href = "https://portal.villagebookbuilders.org/signin">VBB Portal Signin page</a>, where
            you will see a white button for signing in. Click on that, then click on
            the __new_email option. This should allow you to continue to the dashboard, which will give you 
            access to all kinds of mentoring resources and the ability to book your mentoring session!  
            We are currently personally onboarding each new mentor. You will recieve an email in the next few days when 
            you are cleared to book a mentoring session, at which point that option will be made available to you in the portal. 
            We appreceaite your patience with us as we iron out this process!<br><br>

            Lastly, you will see a link for the Mentor Training Module. Please complete this module 
            before your first session.  For further training, tips, news, and events please join our 
            Facebook Group here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/villagementors <br><br>
